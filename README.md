# Mail
> Random modmail bot i decided to make

---

## Packages used:
1. [**discord.js**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js?source=post_page-----7b5fe27cb6fa---------------------- "discord.js NPM link")
  - `npm i discord.js`
2. [**fs**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs "fs NPM link")
 - `npm i fs`

---

## Instructions to make it work

1. Open cmd at file location and type the following
    - `npm i discord.js`
    - `npm i fs`
    - Install nodemon if you want
2. Edit `index.js` and where it clearly says get your own token, put your token... lol
3. Go to `Client.js` and edit the two strings that have random numbers. Change `this.role` to the support role id and the `this.category` to the category you want the tickets to be in.
4. type in console `node .` or if you installed `nodemon`, type `npx nodemon`

## That should be all, bye
